Students from all grades will have the opportunity to participate in creating and maintaining a vibrant garden space on campus. This project aims to teach students about sustainable agriculture, environmental responsibility, and the importance of biodiversity. With hands-on activities such as planting, composting, and harvesting, students will develop essential skills while enjoying the beauty of nature. We look forward to seeing our garden grow and thrive with the care and dedication of our school community.",
