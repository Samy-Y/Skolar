Armed with gloves, trash bags, and a lot of enthusiasm, the students worked tirelessly to collect litter and debris from the park, ensuring the natural beauty of the area was preserved.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe believe in teaching our students the importance of environmental stewardship,\u201d said Principal Amina El-Haddad. \u201cThis activity not only helps the environment but also instills a sense of responsibility and teamwork among our students.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe event concluded with a small ceremony where students shared their experiences and reflections on the importance of keeping their surroundings clean.
